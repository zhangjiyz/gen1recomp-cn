-- Parity test: Vermilion City S.S. Anne sailor (#122).
--
-- pokered VermilionCityDefaultScript (scripts/VermilionCity.asm):
-- stepping onto SSAnneTicketCheckCoords (18,30) facing down always
-- DisplayTextID's the sailor.  With a ticket and the ship still docked,
-- FlashedTicket plays and the player may continue; without a ticket, or
-- after EVENT_SS_ANNE_LEFT, they are walked back up.
--
-- The port used to early-return when the ticket was in the bag, skipping
-- the flash dialog entirely.
--
-- Self-contained; run via `luajit tests/parity_ss_anne_guard.lua`.
