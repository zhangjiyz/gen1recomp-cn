-- a routing row second, which is exactly how growth_rates closed --
-- src/battle/gen2/Mon.lua grew growthFor / registerInto and takes an
-- expForLevel record ahead of the coefficient row, so the registry now routes
-- to the SHARED Gen 1 path and one mod record serves both games.
--
-- `tokens` was on this list by mistake rather than by cause: TextBox.new runs
-- TextBox.substitute on every box in both generations and substitute reads

-- src/render/Pipelines.lua on Gold's merged dataset after mods:load so
-- Game2:draw composites a `present` pipeline.  Both are asserted in the shared
-- set above.
--
-- `transitions` stays because Gold's own intro
-- (src/ui/gen2/BattleTransition.lua) keys STYLES as a boolean SET of the four
-- cart wipes rather than the { frames, draw, sound, flash } record this
-- registry carries, and has no styleDef lookup a mod id could reach.

-- already has to keeping it; these are the systems Red does not have at all
-- (friendship, breeding, the Pokegear, the radio, Pokerus, the roamers, Kurt,
-- the Bug Contest, the Unown puzzle, mail, held items, shininess and gender),
-- so a NEW name is justified -- and the discipline is the same one from the
-- other side: a plain name, never a "gen2." namespace no Gen 1 mod could
-- match, so that when Red ever grows the system the name is already right.
--
-- Three things are asserted per seam, and each one has failed at some point in
-- a review of this programme:
--
--   1. the site exists at all.  docs/mod-api-gen2-compat.md promises these by
--      name, so a deleted emit is doc drift the moment it happens.
--   2. every site is inside a Gen 2 module.  If a Gen 1 site ever appears the
--      seam is no longer Gen 2-only and belongs in the shared lists above,
--      where BOTH halves are checked -- this is the tripwire for that move.
--   3. the site is guarded by Runtime.wants / wantsHook for its own name, so a
--      mod-free boot allocates no payload table.  Several of these sit in the
--      step loop (happiness.changed, roamer.moved) or in the damage path
--      (held_item.trigger, eight triggers a turn), where an unguarded emit is
--      a per-frame cost every player pays for a feature nobody enabled.
