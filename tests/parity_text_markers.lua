-- Parity test: text that has to wait for the player.
-- Self-contained: run via `luajit tests/parity_text_markers.lua`; also
-- dofile'd by tests/run_tests.lua's aggregator.
--
-- The extractor emits three different break markers and they are not
-- interchangeable (src/render/TextBox.lua): \n opens the box's second line,
-- \v scrolls one line in after the down-arrow and a button press
-- (pokered ContText), and \f breaks the page, clearing and waiting.
--
-- Hand-written strings that spell `cont` or `para` as a plain \n put more
-- lines on a page than the two-line box can hold and give the player
-- nothing to press, so the text pours past by itself.  Two of those shipped:
--
--   #239 the trainer-battle run refusal, which lost "trainer battle!"
--   #250 the Viridian caterpillar description, which scrolled six lines by
--
-- Pagination is what the box actually consumes, so asserting on it (rather
-- than on the raw string) is what ties these to the observable symptom.
