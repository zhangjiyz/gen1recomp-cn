-- carrying FRESH_WATER / SODA_POP / LEMONADE hands it over and sets
-- BIT_GAVE_SAFFRON_GUARDS_DRINK.  Only a player carrying none of the three
-- gets the "Gee, I'm thirsty" line and the walk-back.

-- Our port had the removal on the guard's talk handler alone, so walking up
-- with a drink in the bag was turned away and all four gates stayed shut
-- unless the player happened to talk to him -- which vanilla never asks
-- for.  Saffron is the middle of the map, so this sealed the city: Celadon
-- <-> Lavender and the short Vermilion <-> Cerulean crossing both route
-- through it, and the route bot could not reach Lavender for the POKE_FLUTE
-- at all ("travelTo: no route to MR_FUJIS_HOUSE").
