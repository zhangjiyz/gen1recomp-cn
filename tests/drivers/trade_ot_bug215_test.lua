-- Driver (#215): a link-traded mon must keep its ORIGINAL trainer's OT
-- name and ID on the receiving game, not adopt the receiver's identity.
--
-- pokered engine/link/cable_club.asm + home/serial.asm: a trade transmits
-- the whole party data block, which carries each mon's OT ID (party_struct
-- MON_OTID offset) and the OT-names block (wPartyMonOT).  The receiving game
-- copies both verbatim and never overwrites -- a differing OT/ID is exactly
-- what marks a mon as traded (boosted EXP, high-level disobedience).
--
-- The bug: Protocol.packMon/unpackMon dropped mon.ot/mon.otId on the wire,
-- so a received mon arrived ot=nil/otId=nil and SummaryMenu (status_screen.asm
-- StatusScreen) fell back to the local player's name/ID -- the reporter saw
-- the sender's CULLEN/16012 mon show up on the receiver as RED/60368.  This
-- drives the receiver side headlessly: pack a CULLEN-owned mon and unpack it,
-- then read exactly what SummaryMenu draws in the IDNo/OT slots.
