"""Emit src/save_convert/Gen2Layout.lua from a pret build's symbol files.

Gen 2 saves a contiguous WRAM block into SRAM bank 1, so every field's file
offset inside the 32768-byte battery image is

    sPlayerData_offset + (wField - wPlayerData)

with sPlayerData_offset = sPlayerData - $A000 + $2000.  That relation is
asserted below against sPokemonData, which appears on both sides.

Nothing here is transcribed.  Build pret/pokegold and pret/pokecrystal, then:

    python3 tools/gen2_sram_offsets.py \
        --gold  path/to/pokegold.sym \
        --crystal path/to/pokecrystal.sym \
        > src/save_convert/Gen2Layout.lua

Gold and Silver share a layout (pokesilver.sym agrees byte-exact); Crystal does
not, and that is the whole reason this file emits two tables.
