-- The engine's own player-facing text, made overridable.
--
-- Extracted dialogue already had a home: `Data.text`, keyed by pokered's
-- labels, which a mod reaches through `mod.content.text`.  The strings the
-- engine *authors* had none.  Battle messages, item results, menu labels
-- and the link-play screens were literals in Lua, so a translator could
-- reach two thirds of the game and no more (#186, #245).
--
-- Those literals stay where they are, wrapped in `S(...)`, and the English
-- source doubles as the catalog key:
--
--   self:say(S("But, it failed!"))
--   self:say(S("Wild %s\nappeared!", self.enemy.name))
--
-- Keying on the source rather than on an invented id is deliberate.  It
-- keeps the English readable at the point it is used (the alternative
-- scatters a thousand `battle.it_failed` ids that have to be looked up to
-- review a diff), it needs no id registry to stay in sync, and an entry a
-- translation has not covered yet falls through to English instead of
-- rendering a raw id at the player.  The cost is that editing an English
-- string orphans its translations; `tools/modkit.py translation --refresh`
-- reports those as changed keys rather than silently dropping them.
--
-- Same-source-different-meaning is the one case source keys cannot hold on
-- their own ("OFF" as a filter setting vs "OFF" as a toggle, which some
-- languages render differently).  Those sites pass a context:
--
--   S("OFF", "options.musicFilter")   -- key: "options.musicFilter|OFF"
--
-- A mod supplies the catalog through the `strings` registry:
--
--   mod.content.strings:override("But, it failed!", "Echec !")
--
-- With no mod loaded the catalog is empty and `S` is an identity function
-- guarded by one boolean, so a vanilla boot draws byte-identical text.
