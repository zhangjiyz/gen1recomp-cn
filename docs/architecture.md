```

The importer validates the ROM SHA-1, decodes tables and graphics using
bundled address/name metadata, and writes a private cache. It releases the ROM
after import and does not copy it into the cache. Normal gameplay reads only
the generated files.

`tools/build_data.py` is a separate Python/Pillow developer path that writes
the same core data and graphics into the source tree for verification.

## Online play

Online play is owned by the launcher, not by a running game. `src/online/`
holds one persistent relay connection for the life of the process
(`main.lua` pumps it every frame, whether the launcher or a game is on
screen), and a battle is run by **arena booting** the game: no splash, no
title, no overworld, just the lockstep battle, then straight back to the
launcher with the room still selected. In-game link (`src/link/LinkState.lua`)
stays as it was and is LAN only. The relay lives in its own repo,
`../pokeserver`; `docs/link-security.md` describes protocol v2 and what it
does and does not guarantee.

- `src/online/Client.lua` - process singleton: connection, heartbeat,
  reconnect with session resume, the inbox, and the local model (presence,
  room, match, tournament). `Client.roomSession()` hands `LinkBattle` the
  same shape a LAN `Session` does.
- `src/online/Protocol2.lua` - relay protocol v2 message builders; the
  matching schemas live with the v1 ones in `src/link/Wire.lua`.
- `src/online/ArenaData.lua` - computes an ArenaProfile (engine, version,
  engine/api version, fingerprint, ruleset, vanilla or sealed cart) headless
  by mounting a version's cache, and compares two profiles
  (`equal`, `describeMismatch`).
- `src/online/ArenaBoot.lua` - the ArenaSpec: profile, role, slot, team,
  seed, parties, session, `onDone`; plus the battle options a spec turns
  into.
- `src/online/TeamPick.lua` - headless slot read, rule validation and party
  packing. `src/online/Convert.lua` - Gen 1 <-> Gen 2 mon conversion with
  Time Capsule refusals. `src/online/Trade.lua` - launcher-side trade with a
  two-file commit. `src/online/OnlineSprites.lua` - the cached party icons
  and front sprites those pickers draw.
- Boot path: `main.lua` `bootGame(version, cartId, { arena = spec })` ->
  `Game:load` / `Game2:load` skip the intro and push
  `src/ui/ArenaState.lua` or `src/ui/gen2/ArenaState.lua`, which build
  `src/link/LinkBattle.lua` (Gen 1) or `src/link/LinkBattle2.lua` (Gen 2),
  host, guest or spectator, and return the result.
- Mods in an arena: `Loader:load(data, { mode = ... })` runs `disableAll`
  (verified translations only) for a vanilla arena and `cartOnly` for a
  sealed-cart one, without touching the player's saved enable state.
- `src/import/OnlinePanel.lua` plus `src/import/online/` are the launcher's
  ONLINE tab: a small stack of screens (home, play, setup, room, watch,
  tournaments, trade) drawn from `Client`, `ArenaData` and `TeamPick`.

## Map scripts

Map-specific behavior lives in `data/scripts/<map>.lua`, keyed by the
TEXT_* constants from the map's object events. The engine dispatches a
talk interaction to (in order):

1. a hand-ported script in `data/scripts/` (`{ talk = { TEXT_X = {...} } }`),
2. the generic trainer path (object has trainer args from `object_event`),
3. the extracted plain text via the map's text pointer table.

Scripts are arrays of `{ "command", args... }` rows executed by a
coroutine so `show_text`, `ask`, `start_battle`, `warp`, `wait` block
naturally. Every hand-ported script cites its pokered source file.

## Coordinates

- **block**: 32x32 px, the unit of `.blk` layouts (`map.width/height`)
- **cell**: 16x16 px walk grid, the unit of all object/warp coordinates
- **tile**: 8x8 px graphics; a cell is 2x2 tiles, a block 4x4

A cell's behavior (collision, grass, door, warp tile) is decided by its
bottom-left 8x8 tile, matching the original engine's "tile at the
sprite's feet" checks.

## Verification

- `luajit tests/run_tests.lua` - headless behavior suite over real
  generated data (collision, warps, text, stats, damage, growth, type
  chart, encounters, a full scripted battle, save round-trip) using a
  `love` API stub.
- `luajit tests/run_save_editor_tests.lua` (plus the task-specific suites)
  - save editor pure logic and panel click tests.
- `POKEPORT_AUTOPILOT=1 love .` - scripted end-to-end run (walk Pallet
  Town, read the sign, enter Oak's Lab, take a starter, beat the rival,
  exit, cross into Route 1, win a wild battle) that captures screenshots.
- `POKEPORT_DRIVER=tests/drivers/audio_runtime_test.lua love .` - imports
  and queues title music, a sound effect, and a Pokemon cry.
