# Updater

A fused build (`love.filesystem.isFused()` true) ships a bundled `game.love`
baked into the executable, but that bundled copy is only ever the *fallback*.
On every launch, before anything else runs, `Boot.run` (`src/update/Boot.lua`)
looks in the save directory's `updates/` folder for a downloaded
`gen1recomp-X.Y.Z.love` payload that is both strictly newer than the bundled
engine version and runnable on this shell. If one qualifies, it is mounted
over `/` (so its files win over the fused source for every subsequent
`require`) and chainloaded in place: the payload's `main.lua` and `love.load`
run as if they had shipped in the executable. A dev/source checkout is never
fused, so `Boot.run` no-ops there and the working tree always runs itself.

The pieces are deliberately layered so the risky part is small. `Boot.select`
is a pure function (no `love.*` calls) that, given probed candidates and the
bundled `engine`/`shell`, decides what to run and what stale payloads to
delete. `Boot.probePayload` mounts one archive at an isolated mountpoint and
reads its `src/core/Version.lua` with `loadstring` (never `require`, so it is
never cached as a module) to learn its `engine` and `minShell`. `Boot.run`
orchestrates the crash guard, enumeration, selection, and the mount +
chainload, with full rollback on any failure. Checking for and fetching a
new payload is a separate, slower path: `src/update/Check.lua` is a thin
main-thread state machine the launcher screen polls, while the curl calls,
JSON parsing, and sha256 verification run on a background `love.thread`
(`src/update/check_worker.lua`) so a hung network call never blocks a frame.

## Version.lua fields

`src/core/Version.lua` carries four fields the updater reads directly (the
existing `modApi`, `linkProtocol`, `saveFormat`, and `cache` fields are
untouched):

- `engine` - the semver release, e.g. `"1.4.0"`. The repo default is the
  `"0.0.0-dev"` placeholder; CI stamps the real `X.Y.Z` into the packed
  `game.love` only, never the working tree. A `"0.0.0-dev"` engine always
  reports itself up to date (it never chases a release, and it never counts
  as a valid payload to chainload).
- `shell` - the native-shell contract this build's fused executable
  implements.
- `payloadHost` - the native host family an in-place payload targets. Ordinary
  LÖVE packages use `"love"`. A specialized native package uses a distinct,
  stable identifier and accepts only payloads carrying that same identifier.
  A missing field defaults to `"love"`, preserving compatibility with payloads
  released before this field existed.
- `minShell` - the lowest shell contract required to *run* this payload.

Bump `minShell` only when a payload needs something the currently-shipped
native shell cannot provide, for example a LOVE version bump, a new required
system binary, or a change to `love.run` itself (see Known limitations
below). An older shell refuses to chainload a payload whose `minShell`
exceeds the shell it provides; `Boot.select` keeps that payload in `updates/`
rather than deleting it, in case a future shell upgrade can run it, and
`Check`'s worker reports `needs_full` so the player is pointed at a full
installer instead. Do not bump `minShell` for an ordinary Lua/data release;
that is exactly the case the updater exists to avoid a reinstall for.

Change `payloadHost` only when the packaged Lua depends on a different native
host family. This is separate from `minShell`: the host name answers *which*
native integration the payload targets, while the shell number answers *which
revision* of that integration it requires. A mismatched-host payload is never
mounted or deleted as stale; the launcher directs the player to a full package.

## Release assets

Each tagged release `vX.Y.Z` carries the existing per-platform archives
(`gen1recomp-X.Y.Z-macos.zip`, `-windows.zip`,
`-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, `-linux-arm64.AppImage`, `-linux.flatpak`,
`-android.apk`, `-ios.ipa`, `-switch.zip`, Xbox and
PortMaster archives) plus two assets the updater itself consumes:

- `gen1recomp-X.Y.Z.love` - the payload, matched by the exact pattern
  `gen1recomp-<version>.love` (see `isPayloadName` in `Boot.lua` and
  `Check.parseRelease`).
- `sha256sums.txt` - `shasum -a 256` output (`<hex>  <filename>`, bare
  filenames) covering at least the `.love` payload. `Check.parseSums`
  tolerates a leading `*` binary marker and a `./` prefix but expects the
  filename otherwise to match the asset name exactly.

A release missing either asset is treated as "no in-place update available":
`Check` reports `needs_full`. It also selects the exact current platform asset
from the same release and persists the requirement, so it is visible again on
every launch, including offline launches.

## Save-directory layout

Under the save directory (identity `pokemon-love2d`):

```
updates/gen1recomp-<X.Y.Z>.love   downloaded payload(s)
updates/pending.txt                crash-guard marker
updates/full-update.json           persistent native-package requirement
```

`pending.txt` holds the filename of the payload currently being chainloaded.
`Boot.run`'s `chainload` writes it immediately before mounting, and removes it
on both a successful handoff and a clean rollback. If it is still present the
*next* time `Boot.run` starts, the previous boot died mid-handoff, so that
named payload is distrusted: it and the marker are deleted before candidates
are enumerated. Boot may still fall back to an older valid payload, or to the
bundled game, in that case.

## Update flow

1. **Boot** (every launch, fused builds only): crash-guard check, enumerate
   and probe every `updates/*.love`, pick the highest engine that is
   strictly newer than the bundled one and whose `minShell` this shell
   satisfies, delete stale payloads, chainload the winner (or run the
   bundled game if none qualifies).
2. **Check** (launcher screen): `Check.start()` kicks off an async check
   against the GitHub releases API; safe to call every frame, it is a no-op
   once a check is in flight or has reached a terminal state. `Check.state()`
   reports `idle | checking | uptodate | available | downloading | ready |
   needs_full | full_downloading | full_ready | error` plus the latest version,
   download progress, and (when applicable) the selected full-package asset.
3. **Download + verify**: on `available`, `Check.download()` tells the
   worker to fetch the payload, polling the growing `.part` file for
   progress. On completion the worker re-fetches `sha256sums.txt`, verifies
   the payload's sha256, and probes it with `Boot.probePayload` to gate its
   `minShell` against this shell's `shell`. A verified, runnable payload is
   renamed into place and reported as `ready`; anything else reports
   `error` or `needs_full` and leaves `updates/` clean.
4. **Restart to apply**: a `ready` payload just sits in `updates/` until the
   player relaunches; the next launch's Boot step (1) is what actually
   mounts and runs it. There is no in-session hot-swap.
   A shortcut launched with `--update` (`src/core/Prelaunch.lua`, #1657) is
   the one path that does this without the launcher on screen: it runs steps
   2-3 before `bootGame`, and on `ready` writes the one-shot
   `launch_update.txt` marker and restarts, so the fresh boot chainloads the
   payload in step 1 and then boots the game. The marker is consumed on that
   next launch, so a payload that will not apply cannot restart-loop the
   shortcut. `needs_full` is never acted on unattended; it falls through and
   boots the game.
5. **Native-package requirement**: when `minShell` or `payloadHost` is
   incompatible, the worker writes `full-update.json` and surfaces a
   persistent launcher control. Android downloads the release APK, verifies
   its SHA-256 entry from `sha256sums.txt`, then invokes Android's Package
   Installer. The installer asks the user for consent and enforces package,
   version-code, and signing-certificate compatibility. A legacy APK without
   the installer bridge links its full package for one manual bootstrap
   update, including when its downloaded payload already reports the latest
   engine version. iOS links the sideload repository for a re-sideload; Xbox,
   desktop, and PortMaster builds link their correctly named full package.
   Switch keeps its native OTA flow.

## Known limitations


- **`love.run` persists across handoff.** By the time `chainload` runs, the
  bundled `love.run` has already returned its stepper to LOVE; redefining the
  global `love.run` from the payload's `main.lua` does not affect the loop
  already driving the frame. A payload that must change `love.run` itself
  needs a `minShell` bump so an older shell refuses to chainload it rather
  than running with half its intended behavior.
- **Android and iOS use the native download bridge, not curl.** Neither
  platform ships curl, so the old `check_worker.lua` path (shell out to curl)
  always landed on `error` and the launcher chip's "Check for updates" tap
  was a no-op. The worker now talks through `HostShell`, the same transport
  as the mod catalog: curl on desktop, `love.system.httpDownload` on mobile.
  On Android that is the GameActivity JNI/`HttpsURLConnection` bridge; on
  iOS it is `GRPickerBridge.httpDownload` (`URLSession`). A fused sideloaded
  APK or IPA can therefore check GitHub and fetch the `.love` payload
  in-app. If neither transport exists, the worker reports `needs_full` and
  the launcher chip opens `Check.releaseUrl()`. Native package-only changes
  still need a full reinstall (`minShell` / `payloadHost` gate →
  `needs_full`). Applying a downloaded payload on Android relaunches via
  `love.system.restartApp`; iOS still uses in-process `quit("restart")`.
- **Android full updates are user-confirmed and certificate-bound.** The app
  uses a private `FileProvider` cache path plus
  `Intent.ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE`, checks Android 8+'s per-app
  "install unknown apps" setting, and never requests a silent install. The
  release job must use the original long-lived Android signing key; a new key
  causes Android to reject an in-place update and requires a one-time manual
  reinstall. See [mobile/ANDROID.md](../mobile/ANDROID.md).
- **Dev/source runs never self-update.** `Boot.run` returns immediately when
  `love.filesystem.isFused()` is false, and a working tree's `engine` is the
  `"0.0.0-dev"` placeholder that always reports up to date, so a source
  checkout is always "the game" itself; updating it means pulling the repo.
- **Nintendo Switch does not use this LÖVE self-updater.** On NX,
  `Platform.networkValidated()` is `false`, so `Boot.run` / `Check` never
  download `.love` payloads. In-console OTA uses the **native OTA launcher**
  (DEVKITPRO), documented in [switch-install.md](switch-install.md). Wire
  format: `src/update/SwitchOta.lua`. Manual zip install remains the fallback.
